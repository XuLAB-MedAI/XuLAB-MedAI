I joined Xu Lab in 2021 to pursue computational pathology research. During my Master's, I developed AI models for nuclear segmentation/classification and tumor microenvironment analysis in histopathology, utilizing multi-task and transfer learning. Currently, my PhD focuses on H&E-to-IHC stain translation, integrating GANs and diffusion models to address staining variability while preserving diagnostic features. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
