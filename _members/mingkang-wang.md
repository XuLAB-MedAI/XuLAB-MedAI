I graduated from Xu Lab in 2025 and then joined Huawei (Hangzhou) to start my professional career. During my time in Xu Lab, my research focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and the application and development of pathology foundation models. If you are interested in my work or have any questions, please feel free to reach out!
